# Apple Vs Microsoft Stock Price: From 1986 - 2025
## Objective: Analyzing and Comparing AAPL and MSFT prices

In this Jupyter notebook, you can find trends, analyses and comparisons of Apple(AAPL) and Microsoft(MSFT) stock prices. The stock price datasets were downloaded from Kaggle. We'll pandas library to clean and process the data. For visualizations we shall use Seaborn and Matplotlib.

At first, we extract our stock price data from the datasets we found on Kaggle into pandas DataFrames. Next, the data should be cleaned and there should be a new dataset with the stock closing prices and both companies joined on the price date, so that we can see the correlation between the two stocks.

Lastly, we'll visualize line plots for stock price over time, bar charts for daily returns and scatter plots for the correlation between the two stocks using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
